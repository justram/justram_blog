People live for their lives in fear because they’re afraid that they might become a failure.

At least, that’s how I lived.

Everyone struggles to acquire something for all their lives, and they do their best to prove themselves.

But I don’t know what I’m after.

Even if I get what I want, when the things that I thought kept me safe or the things that I thought defined me started to crack, I couldn’t bear it and collapsed.

The things that I thought were me and were the pillars that supported me.

I don’t think they are real.


I learned that it’s ok to fail and that it’s not a big deal.
I learned that I could still be happy even after I fall.
